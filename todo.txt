Commands:
how hot will it be today?
synonyms
define word
wake me up at 7am
what's the weather in PLACE DAY
something about traffic
set a timer for x minutes/seconds
add to calendar
chromecast volume?
on load: warn about unmatched and/or unassigned cmds and links



verify type and possible values for parsed args
move contraction handling to script to prevent duplication in links files
finish conversation sources on quit
don't pass the whole assistant object to plugins/inputs/engines if at all possible
let inputs determine conversation engine (modes?)
CLI interaction engine
add tests
verbose error checking everywhere
remove plugin from assistant.plugins if it wasn't started correctly
move plugin configs from assistant to plugin parameter
document and error check scheduled function thread
enable/disable plugins in main config
put arduino plugin commands instead of hardcoded
remove fstrings to prevent malicious code execution
don't allow input until the InteractionEngine has started

continuous:
define paramater types and values in function annotations
doc strings and comments EVERYWHERE

in progress:
assistant remote
http server input testing and error checking
config file stuff should be in the plugin class
weather plugin should be less messy. cmds and helper functions shouldn't be so entangled.

done:
enable/disable plugins in main config
scheduled functions
reload plugins
notification system
get_status/refresh_status for plugins
linter for regex engine
simplify conversation/dialogue creation syntax (used yaml)
remove duplication b/w plugins and input loading
race condition exists when a conversation engine finishes an interaction before an input receives the new_user_input result
keep track of active plugins/inputs (aka which ones fail to load, etc)
